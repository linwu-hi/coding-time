In this case, it starts distorting even the important parts of the image. In the example below the content-aware image resizing looks pretty similar to a straightforward scaling since for the algorithm all the pixels look important, and it is hard for it to distinguish Van Gogh&#39;s face from the background.</p><figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trekhleb/trekhleb.github.io/master/src/posts/2021/content-aware-image-resizing-in-javascript/assets/12-demo-01.png" alt="Example when the algorithm does not work as expected" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Example when the algorithm does not work as expected</figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-seam-carving-algorithms-works" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-seam-carving-algorithms-works" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How Seam Carving algorithms works</h2><p>Imagine we have a <code>1000 x 500 px</code> picture, and we want to change its size to <code>500 x 500 px</code> to make it square (let&#39;s say the square ratio would better fit the Instagram feed). We might want to set up several <strong>requirements to the resizing process</strong> in this case:</p><ul><li><em>Preserve the important parts of the image</em> (i.e. if there were 5 trees before the resizing we want to have 5 trees after resizing as well).</li><li><em>Preserve the proportions</em> of the important parts of the image (i.e. circle car wheels should not be squeezed to the ellipse wheels)</li></ul><p>To avoid changing the important parts of the image we may find the <strong>continuous sequence of pixels (the seam)</strong>, that goes from top to bottom and has <em>the lowest contribution to the content</em> of the image (avoids important parts) and then remove it. The seam removal will shrink the image by 1 pixel. We will then repeat this step until the image will get the desired width.</p><p>The question is how to define <em>the importance of the pixel</em> and its contribution to the content (in the original paper the authors are using the term <strong>energy of the pixel</strong>). One of the ways to do it is to treat all the pixels that form the edges as important ones. In case if a pixel is a part of the edge its color would have a greater difference between the neighbors (left and right pixels) than the pixel that isn&#39;t a part of the edge.</p><figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trekhleb/trekhleb.github.io/master/src/posts/2021/content-aware-image-resizing-in-javascript/assets/30-pixel-energy-comparison.png" alt="Pixels color difference" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Pixels color difference</figcaption></figure><p>Assuming that the color of a pixel is represented by <em>4</em> numbers (<code>R</code> - red, <code>G</code> - green, <code>B</code> - blue, <code>A</code> - alpha) we may use the following formula to calculate the color difference (the pixel energy):</p><figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trekhleb/trekhleb.github.io/master/src/posts/2021/content-aware-image-resizing-in-javascript/assets/20-energy-formula.png" alt="Pixel energy formula" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Pixel energy formula</figcaption></figure><p>Where:</p><ul><li><code>mEnergy</code> - <em>Energy</em> (importance) of the <em>middle</em> pixel (<code>[0..626]</code> if rounded)</li><li><code>lR</code> - <em>Red</em> channel value for the <em>left</em> pixel (<code>[0..255]</code>)</li><li><code>mR</code> - <em>Red</em> channel value for the <em>middle</em> pixel (<code>[0..255]</code>)</li><li><code>rR</code> - <em>Red</em> channel value for the <em>right</em> pixel (<code>[0..255]</code>)</li><li><code>lG</code> - <em>Green</em> channel value for the <em>left</em> pixel (<code>[0..255]</code>)</li><li>and so on...</li></ul><p>In the formula above we&#39;re omitting the alpha (transparency) channel, for now, assuming that there are no transparent pixels in the image.

On each resizing step the energy map should be re-calculated (at least partially, more about it below) and would have the same size as the image.</p><p>For example, on the 1st resizing step we will have a <code>1000 x 500</code> image and a <code>1000 x 500</code> energy map. On the 2nd resizing step we will remove the seam from the image and re-calculate the energy map based on the new shrunk image. Thus, we will get a <code>999 x 500</code> image and a <code>999 x 500</code> energy map.</p><p>The higher the energy of the pixel the more likely it is a part of an edge, and it is important for the image content and the less likely that we need to remove it.</p><p>To visualize the energy map we may assign a brighter color to the pixels with the higher energy and darker colors to the pixels with the lower energy. Here is an artificial example of how the random part of the energy map might look like. You may see the bright line which represents the edge and which we want to preserve during the resizing.</p><figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trekhleb/trekhleb.github.io/master/src/posts/2021/content-aware-image-resizing-in-javascript/assets/30-energy-map-padding.png" alt="Energy map sketch" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Energy map sketch</figcaption></figure><p>Here is a real example of the energy map for the demo image you saw above (with hot air balloons).</p><figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trekhleb/trekhleb.github.io/master/src/posts/2021/content-aware-image-resizing-in-javascript/assets/40-energy-map.png" alt="Energy map example" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Energy map example</figcaption></figure>',27),C={href:"https://trekhleb.dev/blog/2021/content-aware-image-resizing-in-javascript/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},I=t('<p>We may use the energy map to find the seams (one after another) with the lowest energy and by doing this to decide which pixels should be ultimately deleted.</p><figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trekhleb/trekhleb.github.io/master/src/posts/2021/content-aware-image-resizing-in-javascript/assets/41-seam-search.png" alt="Searching the seam" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Searching the seam</figcaption></figure><p>Finding the seam with the lowest energy is not a trivial task and requires exploring many possible pixel combinations before making the decision.
